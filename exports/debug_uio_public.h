 * debug_uio_public.h
 *
 * Public API for the debug_uio kernel module.
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 * debug_uio creates one UIO (Userspace I/O) device per registered subsystem.
 * Each device exposes two shared-memory maps to userspace:
 *
 *   Interrupt map  –  (struct debug_uio_interrupt_ring_buffer)
 *             A lock-free circular buffer of interrupt-metadata entries.
 *             Each entry records which device raised an event and where in
 *             the mmap window the associated data lives (offset + size).
 *
 *   Data map  –  (struct debug_uio_data_ring_buffer)
 *             A lock-free circular buffer of raw data payloads.
 *             Each entry holds up to MAX_BUFFER_SIZE bytes of opaque data
 *             written by the kernel driver.
 *
 * Kernel drivers interact with this module through the APIs below.
 * Userspace is notified of new entries via a read() on /dev/uioN, which
 * unblocks whenever uio_event_notify() is called by the kernel.
 *
 * Userspace can also send interrupt events back to kernel drivers through
 * the ioctl(IOCTL_SEND_INTERRUPT) interface on /dev/debug_uio_char_dev.
 *
 * The set of supported devices and maps is defined by the constants
 * DEBUG_UIO_DEV_MAX and DEBUG_UIO_MAPS_PER_DEV_MAX.  Adding a new device
 * or map requires only updating those constants and the corresponding
 * lookup tables — no API changes are needed.

/*
 * debug_uio_dev

 * Identifies which UIO device is being addressed.
 * Used by the memory-management APIs (alloc/get/free) and the notifier
 * registration APIs.  The callback APIs (notify / write_data) use a
 * name string instead so that callers do not need to include this enum.
 * New devices can be added by extending this enum before DEBUG_UIO_DEV_MAX.

/**
 * debug_uio_alloc_mem() - Allocate (or replace) the kernel memory that
 *                         backs a UIO map.
 *
 * Description:
 *   Allocates a contiguous kernel buffer of at least @map_size bytes
 *   (rounded up to the next PAGE_SIZE boundary) and registers it as the
 *   backing memory for map @map_type of device @dev_type.  If a previous
 *   allocation already exists for that slot it is freed first.
 *
 *   The allocated buffer is zero-filled.  Its physical address is stored
 *   in the UIO framework's mem[] descriptor so that userspace can mmap()
 *   it via /dev/uioN.
 *
 *   Note: coherent (DMA-consistent) allocation is not supported; passing
 *   is_coherent = true will return NULL immediately.
 *
 * Input:
 *   @dev_type    – Target UIO device (a valid debug_uio_dev enum value,
 *                  less than DEBUG_UIO_DEV_MAX).
 *   @map_type    – Target map slot (a valid debug_uio_map_type enum value,
 *                  less than DEBUG_UIO_MAP_TYPE_MAX).
 *   @map_size    – Requested size in bytes.  Internally rounded up to the
 *                  next PAGE_SIZE boundary.
 *   @is_coherent – Must be false.  Coherent allocation is not implemented.
 *
 * Output:
 *   The UIO framework's mem[@map_type] descriptor for @dev_type is updated
 *   with the new physical address, size, and name.
 *
 * Return:
 *   Kernel virtual address of the allocated buffer on success.
 *   NULL if @is_coherent is true, if @map_size is 0, or if the kernel
 *   cannot satisfy the allocation (ENOMEM).

/**
 * debug_uio_get_mem() - Retrieve the kernel virtual address of an

 *
 * Description:
 *   Returns the kernel virtual address of the memory buffer that currently
 *   backs map @map_type for device @dev_type.  The caller can use this
 *   address to read or write the ring-buffer structures directly from
 *   kernel space without going through the UIO mmap path.

 *
 * Description:

 *   @dev_type and clears the corresponding UIO mem[] descriptor (name,
 *   addr, size are all set to zero/NULL).  After this call the map slot
 *   appears unallocated; any subsequent mmap() attempt by userspace for

/**
 * debug_uio_notify() - Signal an interrupt event to userspace by writing
 *                      metadata into the interrupt ring buffer (map 0).
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called by a kernel driver when an interrupt or notable event occurs
 *   that userspace needs to be informed about.  The function performs the
 *   following steps:
 *
 *     1. Resolves @dev_name to an internal device index by comparing it
 *        against the registered device name strings ("firmware", "host",
 *        "nss").
 *     2. Constructs an interrupt-metadata entry containing the device
 *        index, map type (always DEBUG_UIO_MAP_TYPE_INTERRUPT), @offset,
 *        and @size.
 *     3. Enqueues the entry at the rear of the interrupt ring buffer
 *        (map 0) for the resolved device using a lock-free SPSC algorithm
 *        with smp_wmb() barriers to guarantee visibility.
 *     4. Calls uio_event_notify() to increment the UIO event counter and
 *        wake any userspace thread blocked in read() on /dev/uioN.
 *
 *   Userspace reads the interrupt ring to learn which device raised the
 *   event and at which offset/size in the mmap window the associated data
 *   can be found.
 *
 *   The map type is always INTERRUPT and is therefore not a parameter;
 *   this keeps the calling driver's code simple and avoids misuse.
 *
 * Input:
 *   @dev_name – Null-terminated device name string matching one of the
 *               registered UIO device names (see debug_uio_dev_str[]).
 *   @offset   – Byte offset from the start of the mmap window where the
 *               data associated with this interrupt lives.  Userspace uses
 *               this to locate the data after dequeuing the ring entry.
 *   @size     – Size in bytes of the data at @offset.  Userspace uses this
 *               to know how many bytes to read.
 *
 * Output:
 *   One entry is appended to the interrupt ring buffer of the named device.
 *   Userspace is woken via uio_event_notify().
 *
 * Return:
 *    0          – Success; entry enqueued and userspace notified.
 *   -ENODEV     – @dev_name is NULL or does not match any registered device.
 *   -EINVAL     – Internal UIO info structure is not initialised, or the
 *                 interrupt map has not been allocated.
 *   -ENOSPC     – The interrupt ring buffer is full (all RING_SIZE slots
 *                 are occupied); the entry was dropped.

/**
 * debug_uio_write_data() - Write a data payload into the data ring buffer
 *                          (map 1) and signal userspace.
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called by a kernel driver to push raw data bytes into the data ring
 *   buffer (map 1) of the named UIO device.  This is the companion to
 *   debug_uio_notify():
 *
 *     - debug_uio_notify()    tells userspace WHERE data is
 *                             (offset + size in the mmap window).
 *     - debug_uio_write_data() gives userspace the actual data bytes
 *                             via the data ring, so userspace can dequeue
 *                             them without an additional mmap read.
 *
 *   The function performs the following steps:
 *
 *     1. Resolves @dev_name to an internal device index.
 *     2. Clamps @data_size to MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (1020 bytes) if it exceeds
 *        that limit.
 *     3. Copies @data_size bytes from @data into a new ring entry at the
 *        rear of the data ring buffer (map 1) using smp_wmb() barriers.
 *     4. Calls uio_event_notify() to wake userspace.
 *
 *   Each ring entry holds one independent payload.  The ring has
 *   MAX_NUM_DATA_BUFFERS (4) slots; if all slots are occupied the entry
 *   is dropped and -ENOSPC is returned.
 *
 * Input:
 *   @dev_name   – Null-terminated device name string matching one of the
 *                 registered UIO device names (see debug_uio_dev_str[]).
 *   @data       – Pointer to the data buffer to copy into the ring.
 *                 May be NULL only if @data_size is 0 (enqueues an empty
 *                 entry as a bare notification).
 *   @data_size  – Number of bytes to copy from @data.  Values larger than
 *                 MAX_BUFFER_SIZE are silently clamped to MAX_BUFFER_SIZE.
 *
 * Output:
 *   One entry containing a copy of @data is appended to the data ring
 *   buffer of the named device.  Userspace is woken via uio_event_notify().
 *
 * Return:
 *    0          – Success; entry enqueued and userspace notified.
 *   -ENODEV     – @dev_name is NULL or does not match any registered device.
 *   -EINVAL     – Internal UIO info structure is not initialised, or the
 *                 data map has not been allocated.

 *

/**
 * debug_uio_register_notifier() - Register a callback to receive interrupt
 *                                 events sent from userspace.
 *
 * Description:
 *   Registers @nb with the blocking notifier chain associated with the
 *   (device, map) pair identified by @dev_type and @map_type.  When
 *   userspace calls ioctl(IOCTL_SEND_INTERRUPT) with a matching uioId and
 *   mapId, the kernel invokes all registered notifier callbacks on that
 *   chain, passing the raw interrupt payload as the data argument.
 *
 *   A driver typically calls this during its probe() or init() function
 *   to subscribe to events from a specific device/map combination.
 *   Multiple drivers may register on the same chain; they are called in
 *   priority order as defined by the notifier_block.priority field.
 *
 * Input:
 *   @nb       – Pointer to the caller's notifier_block.  The .notifier_call
 *               field must point to the callback function with signature:

 *   @dev_type – Device whose notifier chain to register on

 *

 *                                  the data ring of a named UIO device.
 *
 * Description:
 *   Controls the behaviour of debug_uio_write_data() when the data ring
 *   buffer (map 1) is full:
 *
 *     @enable = false  (default after module load)
 *       Preserves the original behaviour: the new entry is dropped and
 *       debug_uio_write_data() returns -ENOSPC.  All existing callers
 *       that never invoke this function continue to work unchanged.
 *       This is the backward-compatible default — no action is required
 *       from drivers that want the original drop behaviour.
 *
 *     @enable = true   (opt-in)
 *       The oldest entry in the data ring is silently discarded to make
 *       room for the new one.  The ring always retains the last
 *       MAX_NUM_DATA_BUFFERS events.  debug_uio_write_data() will never
 *       return -ENOSPC while overwrite mode is active for this device.
 *
 *   The setting is per-device and takes effect immediately.  It can be
 *   toggled at runtime (e.g. enabled during a debug session and disabled

 *
 * Description:
 *   Removes @nb from the blocking notifier chain associated with the
 *   (device, map) pair identified by @dev_type and @map_type.  After this
